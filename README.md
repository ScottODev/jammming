# üéµ Jammming - React Spotify Playlist Creator

## üìã **Project Overview**

**Jammming** is a React web application that integrates with the **Spotify API** to provide users with a seamless playlist creation experience. Users can search the Spotify music library, create custom playlists, and save them directly to their personal Spotify accounts.

This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in React development, API integration, and modern web application architecture.

## üéØ **Purpose**

The primary goal of this project is to showcase:
- **React Component Architecture**: Building scalable, reusable components with proper state management
- **API Integration**: Working with external APIs (Spotify Web API) for real-world data
- **User Authentication**: Implementing OAuth flows for secure user access
- **Full-Stack Thinking**: Creating end-to-end user experiences from search to playlist creation

## üõ† **Technologies Used**

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| **Frontend Framework** | React.js (Functional Components + Hooks) |
| **State Management** | React useState and useEffect hooks |
| **API Integration** | Spotify Web API |
| **Authentication** | Spotify OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub |
| **Development Tools** | Create React App, ES6+ JavaScript |
| **Styling** | CSS3 with modern layout techniques |

## üèó **Component Architecture**

- **App** (Root State Management)
  - **SearchBar** (Search Input & Controls)
  - **SearchResults** (Display Search Results)
    - **TrackList** (Reusable Track Container)
      - **Track** (Individual Track Component)
  - **Playlist** (Custom Playlist Management)
    - **TrackList** (Reused for Playlist Tracks)

## üîÑ **Data Flow Patterns**

- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: State flows down through props, events bubble up
- **Prop Drilling**: Functions passed through component hierarchy for state updates
- **Immutable State Updates**: Using spread operators and array methods for clean state management
- **Conditional Rendering**: Components adapt UI based on received props
